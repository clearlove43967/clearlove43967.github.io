Hello! My name is Jiantong QIN, a third year undergraduate student majoring in Artificial Intelligence at The Chinese University of Hong Kong ([CUHK](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html)). I am also a member of the Faculty of Engineeringâ€™s [ELITE Stream](https://www.erg.cuhk.edu.hk/erg/Elite), where I undertake rigorous and in-depth curriculums and receive multiple research opportunities.  

At present, I work closely with Dr. [Jen-tse Huang](https://penguinnnnn.github.io/) on AI fairness and ethics. My research interest lies in Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and AI safety, and I am actively exploring various fields to broaden my knowledge and deepen my expertise.
