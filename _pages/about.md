Hello! My name is Jiantong QIN, a third year undergraduate student majoring in Artificial Intelligence at The Chinese University of Hong Kong ([CUHK](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html)). I am also a member of the Faculty of Engineering‚Äôs [ELITE Stream](https://www.erg.cuhk.edu.hk/erg/Elite), where I undertake rigorous and in-depth curriculums and receive multiple research opportunities.  

Currently, I am working on my Final Year Project under the supervision of Prof. [Michael R. Lyu](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/lyu/home), focusing on Multimodal LLM for UI code generation. I am fortunate to be guided by Mr. [Donald Lam](https://donaldlamnl.github.io/DonaldLamNL/home#!/DonaldLamNL/home) and Mr. [Jingyu Xiao](https://whalexiao.github.io/). Besides, I am also working closely with Dr. [Jen-tse Huang](https://penguinnnnn.github.io/) on evaluating AI models through social science. 

My research interest lies in Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and trustworthy AI, and I am actively exploring various fields to broaden my knowledge and deepen my expertise.
